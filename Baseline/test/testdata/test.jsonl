P . Ross , the policy director for Vote Solar , an organization that advocates for large state-level solar projects , the initiative will stimulate the installation of 3,000 megawatts of solar electrical generating capacity in the state over the next decade .", "That would be an increase by a factor of more than 20 , Mr. Ross said , equivalent to 30 small natural-gas-fired power plants .", "Given the enthusiasm homeowners have shown for the initiative , filing nearly twice as many plans for solar systems with the California State Energy Commission in 2006 than in previous years , this goal may not be far-fetched .", "Other states are considering the future of their solar programs -LRB- several states in the Northeast and the Southwest have less ambitious ones in place , including New York , New Jersey and Connecticut -RRB- , and they are closely watching California 's .", "As the rebate program has made it less expensive to install a home solar system -- and as banks , which consider a solar system to be an improvement that increases a house 's value , have made financing readily available -- the solar industry has grown .", "There are now 434 companies registered to install solar systems by the state energy commission , which together installed just under 50 megawatts of solar electric generating capacity in 2006 , the most in a single year .", "-LRB- California 's total capacity by October was 180 megawatts , enough energy to power about 135,000 homes .", "At the end of 2005 the nationwide solar photovoltaic capacity was 425 megawatts . -RRB-", "While much of the total came from industrial and utility installations , more than 7,000 homeowners filed plans with the state energy commission in 2006 , up from about 4,000 in each of the previous two years .", "The companies are responding not only to an increase in demand , but also to a change in the type of consumers interested in going solar .", "Unlike the do-it-yourself tinkerers who once made up much of the home photovoltaic market , the people fueling the current growth spurt are interested in hands-off user friendliness .", "`` I more or less set it up and then I forgot about it , '' said Nicky Gonz\u00e1lez Yuen , an instructor in political science at De Anza College in Cupertino , who hired a company called NextEnergy to install the modest three-kilowatt system in his 100-year-old Berkeley

, permit applications , rebate processing , installation , maintenance and warranty .", "`` It was a seamless , painless process , '' said Mr. Yuen , whose system cost $ 16,000 after the California rebate and the federal tax credit , which together saved him $ 10,000 .", "It was `` comparable to having a sprinkler system put in , '' he said .", "Mr. Yuen , 47 , was the first on his block to

attention and beginning to think about the whole environmental cycle , '' he added .", "But even as these solar adopters re-evaluate their relationship to the power grid , virtually all of them remain connected to it , which is contrary to the go-it-alone image of the early solar pioneers .", "Though the connection means a house will lose power in a blackout , most home users find the ease of operation makes up for the loss of independence .", "`` All I see is an e-mail from the system once a month , '' said Robert Felton , chief executive of TenFold , a software company , of the report of how much power his mansion in the Oakland hills is using and producing .", "As recently as 10 years ago it was unheard of and , in fact , illegal for solar-powered houses in California to connect to the grid .", "Now power companies are legally required to credit their customers for the excess power they produce .", "The grid , in effect , serves to store power , replacing the bank of batteries that is a component of off-grid systems .", "At the end of the year , credits for solar power added to the grid are applied against charges for power taken from it , helping homeowners `` zero out '' their electricity bills .", "According to Borrego Solar Systems , the company that installed the long rows of solar panels on a hill next to Mr. Felton 's house , two-thirds of its customers manage to do so .", "Excess credits are lost at the end of the year , so homeowners , at least for now , can not make a profit from their solar systems .", "Even so , the savings can be substantial : in 2005 Mr. Felton paid Pacific Gas and Electric about $ 2,500 a month for electricity .", "-LRB- `` I have a whole bunch of fountains and water features and stuff like that , '' he said . -RRB-", "In California residential electricity rates are tiered , and large users like Mr. Felton pay rates about three times higher than more modest consumers , making solar power even more attractive .", "While the average home solar system is about five kilowatts , Mr. Felton 's is 45 kilowatts , and he seldom sees an electric bill .", "Borrego Solar estimated the system could save Mr. Felton almost $ 2 million over 30 years -- far more than the $ 255,000 the system cost him after a $ 134,000 rebate .", "Mr. Felton , 67 , said that a solar system did not make sense when he built his house in 2000 , but that the rebate , as well as rising electricity prices , persuaded him to install the system last year .", "His pragmatic concerns were also informed by broader issues .", "`` I 'm not a hippie

Democrats would court disaster if they even hinted at rolling them back or repealing them .", "But even as Democratic leaders continue to accuse Mr. Bush of having a reckless fiscal policy , they have refused to discuss dismantling his tax cuts or even to engage in a debate with him about the best way to stimulate economic growth .", "`` It 's always the same old tired line with them -- ` Tax and spend , tax and spend , tax and spend , ' '' said Senator Kent Conrad , the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee .", "`` We 're not going there . ``", "At least not now

increase revenues as much as $ 100 billion a year simply by closing the `` tax gap , '' taxes that are owed but not paid .", "When asked about their tax plans , as they have been again and again since Nov . 7 , Democratic leaders insist they want to preserve many of the middle-class tax cuts like the child tax credit and a reduction in the so-called `` marriage penalty '' for two-income households .", "The Democrats ' coyness is less than candid .", "Although it is true that Mr. Bush 's tax cuts have four more years of life , it is also true that Congress faces serious fiscal headaches that can not be postponed for even a full year .", "One of those challenges is the Iraq war .", "The conflict is likely to cost far more than $ 100 billion this year , even if the United States began reducing troop levels .", "So far , Mr. Bush has kept war spending out of the regular budget request that he sends to Congress each February , instead seeking the money on an expedited as-needed basis .", "Democrats say , however , that they will not accede to such requests , as their Republican predecessors did , because they sidestep the process by which Congress normally debates spending priorities .", "Perhaps the bigger and more enduring problem is the alternative minimum tax , a tax that was originally intended for the richest households but that has been not adjusted for inflation and is rapidly engulfing tens of millions of middle-class families every year .", "To prevent the alternative tax from becoming a de facto tax increase , Congress has been passing temporary fixes for the last several years .", "Those fixes now cost more than $ 50 billion a year , and the cost is expected to climb sharply for the rest of the decade .", "Repealing the alternative minimum tax , a goal shared by Democrats and Republicans , would reduce government revenues by about $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years and would be a huge drain on the Treasury that nobody in either party has figured out how to finance .", "Democrats , meanwhile , have a wish list of their own .", "House Democrats plan to reduce interest rates on student loans by half as part of their plan to pass measures that

, new entitlement programs or new tax cuts have to be matched by comparable spending cuts or tax increases .", "Politicians in both parties may be feeling a temporary reprieve from fiscal pressures because the budget deficit has indeed declined sharply in the last two years .", "Largely because of big back-to-back increases in tax revenue for the last two years , the deficit shrank to $ 248 billion in 2006 from a peak of $ 412 billion in 2004 .", "Measured as a share of the total economy , the approach economists view as more meaningful than the deficit size in dollars , the shortfall is 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product , modest by historical standards .", "But many budget analysts remain highly skeptical about Mr. Bush 's promise to eliminate the deficit , noting that the balanced budget would not occur until four years after he had left office .", "One reason for the skepticism is that the government would be renewing all of Mr. Bush 's tax cuts at precisely the time that the 76 million baby boomers have begun pouring into retirement and claiming government benefits from Social Security and Medicare .", "White House budget forecasts have also proven wildly wrong in both good years and bad , as tax revenue plunged far more than officials predicted from 2001 through 2004 and climbed faster than predicted in 2005 and 2006 .", "Despite the recent jump in tax receipts , moreover , federal tax collections are still low as a share of the total economy .", "Spending , on the other hand , climbed sharply as a share of the economy and remains high by historical standards .", "Mr. Conrad of the Budget Committee acknowledged on Tuesday that higher taxes , especially on wealthier families , would eventually have to be part of a comprehensive plan that included tough spending restraint and an overhaul of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare .", "`` I believe that if Americans are told the truth they will support actions necessary to address the budget , '' he said .", "`` If we 're going to be honest about this , it 's going to require both sides ' giving up some of their fundamental positions . ``", "But other Democratic lawmakers say it would be almost pointless to lead an unpopular fight over raising taxes until Republicans are willing to share some of the political pain .", "With Mr. Bush almost certain to fight almost any

accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant .", "His criminal trial , scheduled to begin late this month , will feature none of the initial claims about violent plotting with Al Qaeda that the government cited as justification for detaining Mr. Padilla without formal charges for three and a half years .", "Those claims came from the government 's overseas

constrained by strict federal rules of evidence that would prohibit or limit the use of information obtained during such interrogations , the government will make a far more circumscribed case against Mr. Padilla in court , effectively demoting him from Al Qaeda 's dirty bomber to foot soldier in a somewhat nebulous conspiracy .", "The initial dirty bomb accusation did not disappear .", "It quietly resurfaced in Guant\u00e1namo Bay , Cuba .", "The government filed the dirty bomb charges against Mr. Padilla 's supposed accomplice , an Ethiopian-born detainee , at about the same time it indicted

2005 as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention and the Bush administration , by filing criminal charges , pre-empted its review .", "In a way , Mr. Padilla 's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court .", "After apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002 , the Bush administration made a choice : to detain Mr. Padilla militarily , in order to thwart further plotting , rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution .", "Now that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all , the prosecution 's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration 's view of who he is or what he did .", "Senior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations , admitting , they said , to undergoing basic terrorist training , to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States , and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed , the suspected master planner of the Sept . 11 attacks , before he flew to Chicago in 2002 .", "But any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated , as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court .", "And it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible , either -- and , further , the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas .", "Probably as a consequence , the current criminal case zeroes in on what the government sees as an earlier stage of Mr. Padilla 's involvement with terrorism .", "It focuses primarily on the other defendants ' support during the 1990s for Muslim struggles overseas , especially in Bosnia , Kosovo and Chechnya .", "Mr. Padilla , who was appended to their pre-existing case , in which he had been an unnamed co-conspirator , is depicted as their recruit .", "Although prosecutors have declined to discuss the government 's strategy , their filings and statements in court provide a picture of the case they are expected to present at trial .", "The most tangible allegation against Mr. Padilla is that in 2000 he filled out , under an alias , an Arab-language application to attend a terrorist training camp .", "That application is expected to be offered into evidence alongside the wiretapped
