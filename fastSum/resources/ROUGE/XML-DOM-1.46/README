			Perl module: XML-DOM

Copyright (c) 1999,2000 Enno Derksen

The XML::DOM code is fairly stable and has been used quite a bit.

However, there is a new DOM module, XML::GDOME which is under active
development and significantly faster than XML::DOM, since it is based on
the libgdome C library.  It provides Level 2 of the DOM Core API.  For
more details see http://tjmather.com/xml-gdome/

Patches welcome!  Send them to tjmather@maxmind.com

Paid support is available from directly from the maintainers of this package.

========= DEPENDENCIES =========================================================

You need the following modules (all available at CPAN):

- Perl 5.6.0 or higher (can run under earlier versions, simply remove
	use bytes;
	from lib/XML/DOM.pm)
- XML::RegExp
- XML::Parser (At least version 2.28, 2.30 recommended)
	 If you are using XML::Parser 2.27, then you should download
	libxml-enno-1.02 from your local CPAN mirror.
	If you are using Perl 5.8.0 or greater and XML::Parser 2.32 or lesser, you must apply the
	included XML-Parser-2.31.patch.
- LWP::UserAgent (It's part of libwww-perl. If you don't have it, some test
		  cases may fail and you can't read files from URLs.)
- XML::Parser::PerlSAX (It's part of libxml-perl. You need at least version 0.06.
			If you don't have it some test cases may fail.)

========= INSTALLATION =========================================================

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following.

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

If you have write access to the perl library directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

============= XML::DOM =========================================================

This is a Perl extension to XML::Parser. It adds a new 'Style' to XML::Parser,
called 'Dom', that allows XML::Parser to build an Object Oriented datastructure 
with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface.
For a description of the DOM (Document Object Model), see http://www.w3.org/DOM/

XML::Parser is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl and can be found on CPAN.

This is a beta version and although there will not be any major API changes,
minor changes may occur as we get feedback
from the people on the perl-xml mailing list. [You can subscribe to
this list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@listserv.activestate.com.]
