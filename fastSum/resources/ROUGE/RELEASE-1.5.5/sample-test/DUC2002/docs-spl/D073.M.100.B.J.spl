Pinatubo began erupting about two weeks ago , after six centuries of dormancy .
Located 10 miles from Clark AFB , the explosions have become increasingly severe .
The U.S. has denied the possibility of radioactive contamination if volcanic debris hits the weapons depots at Clark AFB , which was evacuated a week ago .
At least four dead and 24 injured are attributed to the eruptions .
About 84,000 have been evacuated .
Heavy rains today have raised fears of catastrophic mudflows .
According to Foreign Secretary Manglapus , the eruptions should not effect the stalled talks with the U.S. on new Clark and Subic lease agreements .
