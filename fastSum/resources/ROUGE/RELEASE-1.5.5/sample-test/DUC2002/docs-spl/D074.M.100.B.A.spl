From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16 , 1991 the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas .
Thomas 's refusal to answer certain questions caused complaints , but it appeared early on that the committee would approve the nomination .
By the end of the questioning an affirmative vote of 10 - 4 or 9 - 5 was predicted .
There was media attention to Thomas 's wife Virginia .
A successful Washington lawyer , she had taken strong conservative positions that antagonized certain groups and the fact that she was white and he black raised questions for some blacks .
During the hearings lobbyists on either side worked to influence the ensuing vote of the full Senate .
