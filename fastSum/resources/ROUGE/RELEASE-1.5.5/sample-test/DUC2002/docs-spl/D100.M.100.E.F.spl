John Lennon was celebrated in life and death for his music and commitment to world peace .
He had detractors , namely a celebrity biographer in The Lives of John Lennon .
His widow , Yoko Ono , former wife , and sons refuted the alleged misdeeds contained in that book .
On the 50th anniversary of his birth , his song '' Imagine '' was broadcast worldwide to an audience of one billion people .
On the tenth anniversary of his murder , admirers gathered in Liverpool and other locations around the world to pay homage .
Ono has kept his memory alive but many believe she does so for mercenary reasons .
