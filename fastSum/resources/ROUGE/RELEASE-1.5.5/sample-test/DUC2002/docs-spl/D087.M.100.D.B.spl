In the world of international competition , the Olympics are special .
It is here that national pride is displayed , individual dreams are realized and fame is attained .
The summer Olympics with its gymnastics , track and field , and swimming events will showcase superstars such as Mary Lou Retton , Carl Lewis , Florence Griffith Joyner and Greg Louganis , some of whom capitalize on their fame and glory with lucrative advertising contracts .
The Winter Olympics generally highlight the figure skaters , speed skaters and downhill skiers .
Sometimes an Olympian acquires lifelong fame , as happened to Jesse Owens , who in 1936 soundly defeated Hitler 's '' master race '' competitors .
