Britain 's Booker Prize for fiction novels is similar to America 's Pulitzer Prize and National Book awards but more excitement is associated with it .
British publishers each submit three new titles .
The total of around 100 books is narrowed down to a final six by a panel of learned judges after they have read all the novels .
Odds are given with reviews , and literary insiders bet on which book will win the prize .
The winner is announced at a yearly banquet .
The Prize is administered by Book Trust , an educational charity , and sponsored by Booker , an international food and farming business .
