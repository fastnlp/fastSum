An earthquake of magnitude 7.7 hit northwestern Iran on June 21 , 1990 killing at least 50,000 people and leaving 400,000 homeless .
The quake occurred when most people were inside asleep and hit a coastal floodplain where loosely deposited soil shifts easily and caused the fragile adobe homes in the area to collapse .
The Iranian president appealed for international aid and the response was overwhelming , both from countries friendly to Iran 's Islamic government and from those hostile .
Assistance from the United States was the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80 .
Their respective critics blamed the U.S. and Iranian governments for the high death toll .
