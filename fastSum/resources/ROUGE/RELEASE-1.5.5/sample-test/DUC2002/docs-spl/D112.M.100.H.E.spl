Economic confusion surrounds the mysterious death of publishing magnate Robert Maxwell .
Maxwell , who put together a publishing empire following his immigration to Britain in 1940 , was found dead off the coast of the Canary Islands after apparently having fallen overboard from his yacht .
There are allegations that Maxwell , along with two of his sons , Kevin and Ian , and a senior executive in several Maxwell corporations , Michael Stoney , were involved in the illegal transfer of funds to help his publishing empire fend off debt .
The scheme used Swiss trusts and a number of institutions , including the U.S. investment bank , Goldman Sachs .
