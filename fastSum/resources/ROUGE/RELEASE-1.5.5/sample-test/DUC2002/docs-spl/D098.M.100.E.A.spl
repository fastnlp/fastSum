Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope -LRB- HST -RRB- aboard on April 24 , 1990 .
Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident .
Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems , by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth 's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground - based observatories .
The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth .
