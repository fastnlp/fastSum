New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States .
The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin , taken every other day , also reduces heart attack risk .
Aspiring , when taken with clot-busting drugs , has been shown to be especially helpful .
Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease .
Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack .
