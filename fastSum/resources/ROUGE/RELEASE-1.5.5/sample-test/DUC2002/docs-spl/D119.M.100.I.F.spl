Some of President Bush 's nominees for ambassadorships have been selected as a reward for large money contributions to the Republican Party , according to Democratic senators , and some retired diplomats consider a few not to be qualified .
These nominees faced strong questioning from the Democrats during committee hearings but did manage to get a slim approval from the committee .
Conservative senators objected to two of Bush 's selections .
Most of the president 's picks won easy approval .
Two of Bush 's picks received highly favorable reaction : a Latin American expert for ambassador to Nicaragua , and the naming of Thomas Pickering , a well-known diplomat , to India .
