The shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload , the $ 1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope .
While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth , it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground - based observatories .
The telescope 's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled .
Once released , ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope 's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite .
However , scientists , optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational , authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home .
