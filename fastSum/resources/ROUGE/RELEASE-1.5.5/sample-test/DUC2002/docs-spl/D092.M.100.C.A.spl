An earthquake of magnitude 7.7 hit northwestern Iran on June 21 , 1990 killing at least 50,000 people and injuring 200,000 .
The quake occurred when most people were inside asleep and hit a coastal floodplain where loosely deposited soil shifts easily and caused the fragile adobe homes in the area to collapse .
The Iranian president appealed for international aid and the response was overwhelming , including assistance from the United States , the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80 .
On the negative side , Iranian news media were slow to report on the disaster and the Iranian and U.S. government were blamed by their respective critics for the excessive casualties .
