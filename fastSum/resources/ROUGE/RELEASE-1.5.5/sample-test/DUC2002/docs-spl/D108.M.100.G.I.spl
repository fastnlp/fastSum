After two weeks of accusations and maneuvering , Iraq invaded tiny Kuwait on August 2 with 100,000 battle-trained troops , quickly taking the country .
While the Kuwaiti emir and refugees fled to Saudi Arabia , Iraq began rounding up foreign nationals and repopulating the nation with Iraqi citizens .
Some foreigners were taken to Iraq , while some were flown to Jordan .
Reactions to the invasion have been strong .
The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed trade and military sanctions and President Bush said he would defend U.S. interests .
Iran rejoiced .
Most nations are strongly enforcing these sanctions as oil prices soar and Iraq begins defensive preparations .
