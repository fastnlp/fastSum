Former Texas Senator John Tower and his daughter were killed in the crash of a commuter plane on Sea Island , off the coast of Georgia .
Senator Tower had been President Bush 's nominee for Secretary of defense , but the nomination was rejected by the Senate on the recommendation of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
This was only the ninth time in history that a cabinet nominee has been rejected .
The committee recommended rejection after hearing allegations about Tower 's use of alcohol and his inappropriate behavior towards women .
The committee also questioned his dealings with defense contractors after Tower gave contradictory testimony .
