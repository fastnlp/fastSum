Lucille Ball , who died in April 1989 at the age of 77 , will long be remembered .
She made her craft look easy , spontaneous and unrehearsed .
The result was the durable and probably the finest series in television , '' I Love Lucy '' .
She starred in the show along with her husband Desi Arnaz , and together they founded Desilu Productions , which eventually took over RKO Studios and television and produced many popular television shows .
The couple had two children and divorced in 1960 .
Condolences poured in form all over the country in which she was credited with helping to establish television as the nation 's leading entertainment industry .
