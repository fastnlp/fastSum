Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev returned to power as the coup against him collapsed , unraveling swiftly as junta was unable to cope with thousands of people who created barricades around the Russian Parliament , Russian President Yeltsin 's stronghold .
The national legislature demanded Gorbachev 's reinstatement and the Communist Party , seeking to salvage its image , denounced the takeover .
The real issue for the coup failure was not Gorbachev but the new political culture of democracy he initiated .
At first Gorbachev and Yeltsin appeared as equals but Yeltsin , who challenged the Communist Party and stayed close to the Russian people , trumped Gorbachev .
