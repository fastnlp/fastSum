George Bush 's choice of Dan Quayle as his running mate surprised most political observers , but was quickly supported by many of Quayle 's fellow Republican senators .
Quayle was viewed as a lightweight and questions were raised about his military service and errors in his official resume .
His main attributes were party loyalty and identification as a devoted family man .
Quayle contributed little to the campaign and , after being elected , all but disappeared from the political scene .
President Bush , however , continued to voice support for , and confidence in Quayle .
His friends , especially in his home town , called him a winner .
