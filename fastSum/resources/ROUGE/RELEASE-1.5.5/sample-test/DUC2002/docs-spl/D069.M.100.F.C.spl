East Germany was near chaos by the end of 1989 .
Woeful economic conditions prevailed .
Massive demonstrations for democratic reform swept the nation .
The hard-line Communist government admitted its failure , giving strong impetus to the German reunification movement .
The Soviets endorsed it in February as the World War II Allies did later .
Unification was now imminent .
The specter of an economically and politically powerful Germany disturbed many , but particularly the Poles , Soviets and world Jewry .
Despite concerns , reunification would be accepted as a lesser threat than a chaotic East Germany .
