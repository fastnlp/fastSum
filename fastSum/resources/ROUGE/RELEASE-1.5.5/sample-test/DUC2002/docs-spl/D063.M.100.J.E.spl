An Irish Republican Army bomb destroyed a barracks belonging to the Royal Marines Music School in Deal on Friday .
The blast killed 10 and injured 22 others and also damaged or destroyed neighboring houses .
Neighbors and opposition politicians blamed lax security and condemned the use of private security firms at this and 29 other bases in Britain considered to be low risk .
The IRA said the blast was in response to a speech by Prime Minister Thatcher to the Ulster Defense Regiment , calling the speech an '' act of war . ''
This is the latest of a series of attacks as the IRA seeks the withdrawal of British forces from Northern Ireland .
