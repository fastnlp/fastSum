The two largest property insurance companies in the Carolinas , State Farm and Nationwide , estimate Hurricane Hugo losses at $ 600 million , making it the costliest hurricane ever .
Hugo , a Category 4 storm dubbed a '' killer hurricane '' by Charleston 's mayor , struck the city Thursday night .
Though there was significant damage , only two were killed in Charleston , 17 total in South Carolina .
Officials credit the low number of fatalities to residents who heeded Hurricane Center warnings and evacuated before the storm 's arrival .
Kingston , New York , assisted by Charleston during the Revolutionary War , is repaying the kindness by sending money to help the city recover .
